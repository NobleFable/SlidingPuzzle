# SlidingPuzzle
Implementation of 15 Puzzle (5x5 version) using WPF in .NET

This is a simple implementation of the 15 Puzzle, with additional menus for added complexity. Most of the resources used in this project are placeholders.

**Note:** There is currently an issue with the ShuffleUtility not providing a valid randomized set, which will result in the puzzle being unsolvable.
